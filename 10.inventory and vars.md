🧪 Hands-On Lab: Host Inventory & Ansible Variables

🧩 Lab Prerequisites
	1.	Ubuntu system (localhost is fine)
	2.	Ansible installed

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible


	3.	Create a working directory:

mkdir -p ~/ansible-lab/inventory
cd ~/ansible-lab

🔹 Stage 1: Basic Static Inventory

✅ Task:

Create a file called inventory/hosts.ini:

[web]
localhost ansible_connection=local

✅ Test:

ansible -i inventory/hosts.ini web -m ping

🧠 Expected Output: "pong" from localhost.

🔹 Stage 2: YAML Inventory & Group Variables

✅ Task:
	1.	Replace INI with a YAML inventory: inventory/hosts.yml

all:
  children:
    web:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local

	2.	Create inventory/group_vars/web.yml

web_package: nginx

	3.	Run an ad-hoc command using the variable:

ansible -i inventory/hosts.yml web -m debug -a "msg={{ web_package }}"

🧠 Expected Output: msg: nginx

🔹 Stage 3: Host-Specific Variables

✅ Task:
	1.	Create inventory/host_vars/localhost.yml

custom_port: 8080

	2.	Test with this playbook print-vars.yml:

- name: Print host-specific vars
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Show port
      debug:
        msg: "Port used is {{ custom_port }}"

✅ Run:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml print-vars.yml

🧠 Expected Output: "Port used is 8080"

🔹 Stage 4: Use vars in a Real Task (Install a Package)

✅ Task:
	1.	Update group_vars/web.yml

web_package: nginx

	2.	Create install-package.yml:

- name: Install package on web group
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure package is absent (simulate reinstall)
      apt:
        name: "{{ web_package }}"
        state: absent
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Ensure package is installed
      apt:
        name: "{{ web_package }}"
        state: present

✅ Run:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml install-package.yml

🧠 Expected Result: nginx is reinstalled.

🔹 Stage 5: Groups of Groups & Default Group

✅ Task:
	1.	Update your inventory hosts.yml:

all:
  children:
    web:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local
    backend:
      hosts:
        db1:
        db2:
    app:
      children:
        web:
        backend:

	2.	Create group_vars:

mkdir -p inventory/group_vars/app

	3.	inventory/group_vars/app.yml

env: production

	4.	Test with this playbook show-env.yml:

- name: Display environment
  hosts: app
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "Environment is {{ env }}"

✅ Run:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml show-env.yml

🧠 Expected: All hosts under web and backend display “Environment is production”.

📝 Bonus Quiz (Optional)
	1.	What file defines a group-wide variable?
	2.	What file overrides a variable for a specific host?
	3.	Which format is preferred for inventories: INI or YAML?
	4.	What is the precedence order for variables?
